When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when we need to collaborate with other developers or when we want to access repository on multiple systems.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    we might be working on something and automatics pull changes would download changes introduced by other and break our commit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    branch is used to introduce experimental feature that are not ready to be part of master branch at now.
    Clone is used to copy one repository (remote or local) to local system.
    forks is used to copy a GitHub repository of other people to our profile. This is particularly useful when we are not allowed to 
    introduce change in original repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
